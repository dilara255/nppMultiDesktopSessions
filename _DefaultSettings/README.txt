TODO: Small description of what this does;
TODO: Rename from Notes to Session;

1) Make sure the paths in "openNotes.bat" are correct.
2) Copy "openNotes.bat" to the folder where you want to create a new session file;
3) Run it. Add files to the session and simply close npp when you're done;
4) To reopen the session run "openNotes.bat" from the same folder again.

* You can of course rename "openNotes.bat" and/or create shortcuts to it.
* You can do this in as many folders as you may want to create independent sessions, but only a single session per folder is supported.
